This is a project where I follow JabaBrain's tutorial series about Spring Boot. From the very basic to a working web application.


- To run this Application, run: CourseApiApp.

### Packages ###



##### Course and Topic: #####

These packages follow the principle of MVC. There is a Model (Course/Topic)
and a Controller (Course- Topic-Controller). When it comes to View there is
no specific class for this, but Course- and Topic-Service is a class that is
used to present the data trough HTTP-links and let you use GET-,
PUT-, POST- and DELETE-REQUESTS.

##### Hello: #####
This is just a package with one simple test. You can preform a simple GET-REQUEST.
